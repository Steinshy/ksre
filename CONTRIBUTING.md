# Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Katawa Shoujo: Re-Engineered. Our project has only been able to grow because of our community support. This document describes what tools are needed for building game, what you as user/developer can do to help and make contributions that would most likely to be accepted by main developers.
